# Algorithmically Detecting Technical Patterns

See the [Medium writeup here](https://medium.com/automation-generation/algorithmically-detecting-and-trading-technical-chart-patterns-with-python-c577b3a396ed).

[This notebook](https://github.com/samchaaa/alpaca_tech_screener/blob/master/tech_screener_notebook.ipynb) takes in price data, finds minima and maxima points, and detects technical patterns (specifically an inverse head & shoulders) in price.

You can also record returns after occurrences of a patterns to find if your pattern has edge over time.
